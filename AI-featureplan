High-Level AI/ML Readiness Plan
Step 1: Define Use Cases & Labels

Identify the ML problems you want to solve:

Demand Forecasting → predict future orders per menu item / restaurant.

Fraud Detection → identify suspicious orders or revenue anomalies.

Menu Optimization → recommend best-selling items and promotions.

Determine labels for each use case:

Demand Forecasting → next-day or next-hour order count.

Fraud Detection → 0/1 flag based on historical fraud cases.

Menu Optimization → high_sales = 1 if item is top X% of sales.

Step 2: Prepare Features

Pull curated tables from existing pipelines (Orders, Menu, Revenue, Delivery).

Engineer features relevant to each ML use case:

Order trends (rolling averages, day-of-week effects)

Revenue patterns

Delivery success rates

Promotions active

Ensure features are timestamped and consistent across tables.

Step 3: Merge Features & Labels

Combine engineered features with their corresponding labels into a single ML dataset.

This dataset will be the training source for all models.

Step 4: Store Features in SageMaker Feature Store

Create feature groups for each ML domain (e.g., demand_forecasting, fraud_detection).

Ingest the ML dataset into the Feature Store:

Offline store → batch training

Online store → real-time inference if needed

Feature Store ensures centralized, versioned, and reusable features across multiple models.

Step 5: Model Training & Deployment

Use SageMaker to train models using the Feature Store:

Demand Forecasting → time-series models (Amazon Forecast or DeepAR)

Fraud Detection → classification models (XGBoost, Random Forest)

Menu Optimization → regression or recommendation models

Deploy models for batch predictions or real-time inference.

Step 6: Automation & Orchestration

Schedule daily or hourly feature extraction and label computation using existing pipelines + Airflow / Lambda.

Automate ingestion into Feature Store and model retraining.

Monitor data quality, feature drift, and model performance via CloudWatch and QuickSight dashboards.

Step 7: Monitor & Iterate

Validate predictions against real outcomes.

Update features or labels as business requirements evolve.

Add new ML use cases by creating new feature groups and labels without touching raw pipelines.
