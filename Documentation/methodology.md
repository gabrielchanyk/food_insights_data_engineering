# 📝 Methodology

Start with the **end goal**: what is our product, and what do we need to drive business decisions?  
Focus on answering questions like: _Where are we losing money, and how can we make more money?_

**Key Business Use Cases:**

- Revenue insights
- Fraud detection
- Menu optimization

**Approach:**

1. Explore and evaluate data sources — ensure they provide the right information for your use cases.
   - _Note: For this case study, we assume all sources have the necessary data._
2. Data Exploration → Technology Evaluation → Data Pipeline Logic to clean & normalize data
3. Business Insights → AI-enabled analytics or human-driven decisions
4. Monitoring & Failure Scenarios → ensure reliability and observability

Data Exploration -> Technology evaluation -> Data pipeline logic to clean data -> Business insights (AI empowered or human) -> Monitoring/Failure Scenarios
