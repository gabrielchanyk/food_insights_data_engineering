## AI/ML Use Cases

### 1. Demand Forecasting

- **Goal:** Predict orders per restaurant, menu item, or time window.
- **Data Required:** Historical orders, promotions, menu changes, region, and events.
- **Business Value:** Helps predict which promotions or menu changes in specific regions could drive more business/revenue.

### 2. Fraud Detection

- **Goal:** Identify anomalous orders, deliveries, or revenue transactions.
- **Data Required:** Order details, revenue, delivery data, payment history, location data.

### 3. Menu Optimization

- **Goal:** Recommend best-selling items, optimize pricing, and promotions.
- **Data Required:** Orders, revenue, customer feedback, delivery performance, promotions.

## High-Level AI/ML Readiness Plan

### Step 1: Define Use Cases & Labels

- **Identify ML problems:**
  - Demand Forecasting â†’ predict future orders per menu item / restaurant.
  - Fraud Detection â†’ identify suspicious orders or revenue anomalies.
  - Menu Optimization â†’ recommend best-selling items and promotions.
- **Determine labels for each use case:**
  - Demand Forecasting â†’ next-day or next-hour order count.
  - Fraud Detection â†’ 0/1 flag based on historical fraud cases.
  - Menu Optimization â†’ high_sales = 1 if item is top X% of sales.

### Step 2: Prepare Features

- Pull curated tables from existing pipelines: Orders, Menu, Revenue, Delivery.
- Engineer features relevant to each ML use case:
  - Order trends (rolling averages, day-of-week effects)
  - Revenue patterns
  - Delivery success rates
  - Promotions active
- Ensure features are **timestamped** and consistent across tables.

### Step 3: Merge Features & Labels

- Combine engineered features with corresponding labels into a single ML dataset.
- This dataset will be the **training source for all models**.

### Step 4: Store Features in SageMaker Feature Store

- Create **feature groups** for each ML domain (e.g., demand_forecasting, fraud_detection).
- Ingest the ML dataset into the Feature Store:
  - **Offline store:** batch training
  - **Online store:** real-time inference if needed
- Feature Store ensures **centralized, versioned, and reusable features** across multiple models.
